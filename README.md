**Overview:**
According to US Foods, the average American dines out 4.6 times per month and orders takeout 3 times per month. The remaining 82.4 meals are prepared at home, and this website seeks to help answer the perpetual question of “what should I make?” The site will catalog recipes that can be made given certain ingredients. It also will provide tracking for what’s been made previously, how much it costs to make the recipe, how easy it was to make, and how well it was received. Recipes will be categorized into the type of cuisine. By putting these facts into the user’s hands, it will help narrow the choices available to a more manageable level, helping to make a final decision.
